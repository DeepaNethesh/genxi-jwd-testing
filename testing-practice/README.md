# Mocha testing with chai

## Description

Now it's time to try out some unit testing without any help! I found some practice exercises to do from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/latest/my-languages).
They get harder the further down the list you go, so start with something easy and work away until you get stuck. 

### Starting a problem

We are trying to create some tests for a particular issue, then use javascript to solve that issue while passing all the tests we have created! 

Check out [chai assertions](https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/) and figure out which one to use for your problem! 

Create a separate file for tests and challenges. You can use mocha in nodejs and the console, or create a html file and link the script tags. However you prefer! 

Keep whatever work you have completed and show me once you are finished for the day :) 

### 1. GradeBook
Complete the function so that it finds the mean of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Numerical Score	Letter Grade
90 <= score <= 100	'A'
80 <= score < 90	'B'
70 <= score < 80	'C'
60 <= score < 70	'D'
0 <= score < 60	'F'
Tested values are all between 0 and 100. There's is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100.

### 2. Summation

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

### 3. Even or Odd
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

### 4. Repeat 
Write a function called repeatString which repeats the given string str exactly count times.

repeatString(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
repeatString(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

### 5. Codewars and beyond...
Go back over your code and apply a different problem solving technique to all of the challenges. You should come up with a few different solutions!
